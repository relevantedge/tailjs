              "description": "Tags in tail.js are a flexible form of key/value pairs that can be used to categorize events, track component parameters and add contextual information to content data organized in a taxonomy specific to your business domain.\n\nExamples of tags are `promotion, color=black`, `rendering:component:theme=dark`, `ad-campaign=43899`,  `ext1:video:play` and `area=investors+9, area=consumers+2`\n\nAs in the examples above, tags can optionally have a value indicated by an equals sign (`=`), and the labels can be organized in taxonomies with each rank/taxon separated by a colon (`:`).\n\nIt is possible to specify \"how much\" a tag applies to something via a _tag score_. A common use case is to get a straight-forward way categorize sessions based on the users interests. For example, if a user mostly clicks on CTAs and reads content with tags like `audience=investors+8,audience=consumers+1` the score for the \"investors\" audience will ultimately be higher than the score for \"consumers\".\n\nTags are separated by comma (`,`).\n\nThe following rules apply:\n- There should not be quotes around tag values. If there are they will get interpreted as part of the value.\n- Tag names will get \"cleaned\" while they are tracked, and all letters are converted to lowercase and other characters than numbers,  `.`, `-` and `_` are replaced with `_`.\n- Tag values can be mostly anything, but you should keep them short and prefer referencing things by their external ID instead of their names.\n- If you need the `,` literal as part of a tag value it can be escaped by adding a backslash in front of it (`\\,`), however using commas or similar characters   to store a list of values in the same tag is discouraged as each value should rather have its own tag.\n\nBAD: `selected=1\\,2\\,3`, `selected=1|2|3` GOOD: `selected=1, selected=2, selected=3`\n\nBAD: `event=My social gathering in July,source=eventbrite` GOOD: `event:eventbrite:id=8487912`\n\nBAD: `campaign:promo=true, utm_campaign:fb_aug4_2023` GOOD: `campaign:promo, utm:campaign=fb_aug4_2023`\n\nTags can either be added directly to content and component definitions when events are tracked, or added to the HTML elements that contain the components and content.\n\nTags are associated with HTML elements either via the `track-tags` attribute, or the  `--track-tags` CSS variable in a selector that matches them, and these tags will be added to all content and components they contain including nested HTML elements.\n\nSince stylesheets can easily be injected to a page via an external tag manager, this makes an easy way to manage the (tail.js) tags externally if you do not have access to developer resources.",

Even when correctly referencing a immutable ID you might still want to include the name to make it possible to add labels in your analytics reporting without integrating additional data sources. The names may then still be wrong after some time, but at least then you have the IDs data does not get lost, and you have a path for correcting it.\n\nAgain, if you only have some hard-coded value, you can just make an external reference and use its  {@link  id }  property for the value.
