The library embeds natively in your frontend code and CMS to automatically identify components, content blocks, forms and products and provide detailed information on how users interact with them. It also tracks navigation paths between pages and external links, taking into account how the user opened and closed browser tabs and went between them with accurate engagement timing.

Most other tracking solutions rely on manual boiler-plate code and hand-held tag management to achieve some level of component-level tracking whereas tail.js' automated approach captures everything by its CMS definitions. This also means that it gets reflected in already collected data when you rename and move pages around.

In addition to CMS based components it also tracks code based components, so you can see what people click based on the names of your front-end component and server-side renderings even without a CMS.
