Tail.js is a library for building first-party, integrated web analytics solutions with minimal effort and strong guarantees for privacy protection and data ownership.

It is a generalized event tracker and data layer that is not tied to a specific database, frontend or server technology. It can work stand-alone, but features an extensible architecture so it can also enrich CRM and CDP platforms, and even other analytics platforms.

## Features

- It enables _full ownership_ of analytics data on-prem.
- It is first-party only and has strong guarantees for privacy protection. It is next to impossible for third-party services to eavesdrop and finger-print users.
- It uses code analysis and your CMS to automatically track how users interact with all content, components, forms and products across your entire website from the moment you add the library to your solution.
- It is fully featured with minimal implementation and maintenance overhead, as it does not require breakable boilerplate code all over your solution.
- It combines client and server technologies to provide comprehensive tracking capabilities both in frontend and behind API endpoints.
- It has practically invisible performance overhead.

## The library includes

- An event tracker and data layer that combines client and server-side tracking through the same API.
- A server-side engine with extensions points for data destinations.
- Extensions for storing data in popular databases
- An extension for MaxMind GeoIP data.
- A strongly typed, rich and documented event model.
- Integrations to Umbraco and Sitecore
- ASP.NET integration
- React extensions
- NextJS integration
