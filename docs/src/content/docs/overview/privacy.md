Not sharing is caring. Privacy is protected by avoiding client-side cookies and and a custom layer of encryption for all data _in use_, _in motion_ and _at rest_. This effectively makes data stored in devices unrecognizable, and prevents data from being snatched and used for fingerprinting by third-party services and rogue browser extensions. Additionally, the data layer is locked down to your own code so third-parties exploit the API to gain information about the user even if they know the tail.js API.

A deeper walk-through of exactly how this works will follow soon.
