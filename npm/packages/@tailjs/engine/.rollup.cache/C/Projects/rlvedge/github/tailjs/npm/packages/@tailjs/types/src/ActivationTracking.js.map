This is the default value\n * - `direct`: Only include the closest component that contains the activated element.\n * - `region-context`: Like `context` and adds the bounding rectangle of component elements and pointer coordinates.\n * - `region-direct`: Like `direct` and adds the bounding rectangle of component elements and pointer coordinates.\n * - `all`: The most elaborate option.
